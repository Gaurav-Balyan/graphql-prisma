+ need to use Node version 12 to be able to successfully run prisma init command hence using nvm to use specific version

+ used graphql-yoga as graphql server

+ graphql config is used to get schema properties which would be created in generated folder to be used in NodeJS

+ we can use http://localhost:4466 to communicate with graphql operations

+ use prisma deploy -e ../config/{config}.env forpreferred environment

+ use environmental variables for confidential information

+ use jest for unit testing

+ use gql to generate graphql operations from client

+ deployed on heroku and used postgres for persisting data
